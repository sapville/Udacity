			<p>At first glance many might mistake Masyanya for a cat.
				However, it usually takes little time to realise that she is not.
				Despite her deceptive appearance (which shamefully includes a tail)
				she bears all the characteristics of a supreme race â€“ stern and
				arrogant manners, a demanding voice and an intrinsically wise look.
				She would be deeply insulted if someone dared call her a cat.</p>
